Imputation of missing values

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.impute

For various reasons, many real world datasets contain missing values, often
encoded as blanks, NaNs or other placeholders. Such datasets however are
incompatible with scikit-learn estimators which assume that all values in an
array are numerical, and that all have and hold meaning. A basic strategy to use
incomplete datasets is to discard entire rows and/or columns containing missing
values. However, this comes at the price of losing data which may be valuable
(even though incomplete). A better strategy is to impute the missing values,
i.e., to infer them from the known part of the data.

The :class:`SimpleImputer` class provides basic strategies for imputing missing
values, either using the mean, the median or the most frequent value of
the row or column in which the missing values are located. This class
also allows for different missing values encodings.

The following snippet demonstrates how to replace missing values,
encoded as ``np.nan``, using the mean value of the columns (axis 0)
that contain the missing values::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
    >>> imp = SimpleImputer(missing_values='NaN', strategy='mean')
    >>> imp.fit([[1, 2], [np.nan, 3], [7, 6]])       # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    SimpleImputer(copy=True, missing_values='NaN', strategy='mean', verbose=0)
    >>> X = [[np.nan, 2], [6, np.nan], [7, 6]]
    >>> print(imp.transform(X))           # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE  +ELLIPSIS
    [[4.          2.        ]
     [6.          3.666...]
     [7.          6.        ]]

The :class:`SimpleImputer` class also supports sparse matrices::

    >>> import scipy.sparse as sp
    >>> X = sp.csc_matrix([[1, 2], [0, 3], [7, 6]])
    >>> imp = SimpleImputer(missing_values=0, strategy='mean')
    >>> imp.fit(X)                  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    SimpleImputer(copy=True, missing_values=0, strategy='mean', verbose=0)
    >>> X_test = sp.csc_matrix([[0, 2], [6, 0], [7, 6]])
    >>> print(imp.transform(X_test))      # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE  +ELLIPSIS
    [[4.          2.        ]
     [6.          3.666...]
     [7.          6.        ]]

Note that, here, missing values are encoded by 0 and are thus implicitly stored
in the matrix. This format is thus suitable when there are many more missing
values than observed values.

:class:`SimpleImputer` can be used in a Pipeline as a way to build a composite
estimator that supports imputation. See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_missing_values.py`.

The :class:`KNNImputer` class provides imputation for completing missing
values using the k-Nearest Neighbors approach. Each sample's missing values
are imputed using values from ``n_neighbors`` nearest neighbors found in the
training set. Note that if a sample has more than one feature missing, then
the sample can potentially have multiple sets of ``n_neighbors``
donors depending on the particular feature being imputed.
Each missing feature is then imputed as the average, either weighted or
unweighted, of these neighbors. Where the number of donor neighbors is less
than ``n_neighbors``, the training set average for that feature is used
for imputation. The total number of samples in the training set is, of course,
always greater than or equal to the number of nearest neighbors available for
imputation, depending on both the overall sample size as well as the number of
samples excluded from nearest neighbor calculation because of too many missing
features (as controlled by ``row_max_missing``).
For more information on the methodology, see ref. [#]_.

The following snippet demonstrates how to replace missing values,
encoded as ``np.nan``, using the mean feature value of the two nearest
neighbors of the rows that contain the missing values::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer
    >>> nan = np.nan
    >>> X = [[1, 2, nan], [3, 4, 3], [nan, 6, 5], [8, 8, 7]]
    >>> imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=2, weights="uniform")
    >>> imputer.fit_transform(X)
    array([[1. , 2. , 4. ],
           [3. , 4. , 3. ],
           [5.5, 6. , 5. ],
           [8. , 8. , 7. ]])


:class:`KNNImputer` can also be used in a Pipeline as a way to build a
composite estimator that supports imputation.
